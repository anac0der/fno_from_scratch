## FNO from scratch

This repo contains an implementation of Fourier Neural Operator from scratch using PyTorch.

That implementation is a part of my university task. You can see task conditions in pdf file and full task in ipynb file.

For requirements installing, create virtual environment with ```venv``` and do ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
